When I first joined,
you had two seasons a year,

00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,058
so you'd make something
that'd sell for six months.

Nowadays, with
the introduction of fast fashion,

about having newness every month.

[Kyle] Honestly, it's getting worse.

We're seeing more and more companies

There's one category of product
that we're very frustrated with right now,

514
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,818
that unfortunately is massively popular,

515
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,654
and that is AirPods

{\an8}Each earbud has a battery
and then the charging case has a battery.

and swap out the battery in any of them.

518
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:18,209
The batteries will degrade
after 18 months, a couple years,

00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,753
and then you're stuck
and you have to go and buy new ones.

This is evil.

I... I am a reasonable person

00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,353

from their phone,

526

so they forced everyone to buy these.

Based on my opinion
of being in thousands of stores

742
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:10,147
and trying to find factories
that actually recycle things,

743
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:14,985
the vast majority of recyclable labels
on plastic packaging today are false.

744
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:19,365
I've worked with the biggest,
most well-known brands

I have helped companies figure out
how to design and manufacture safely,

efficiently, and really
environmentally best way.

And these companies worked really hard

749
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:43,889
to make their factories really efficient
and not hurt the environment.

750
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:49,895
But once they made the product
and they put it on the store shelf,

751
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,898
they wipe their hands of it.

752
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:56,985
And they say,
"That is not our responsibility."

753
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:01,365
You can see the plastic packaging
is everywhere in the stores today,

754
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:04,118
and consumers can't even avoid it.

755
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:08,539
The truth is, is that the vast majority
of plastics are not recyclable.

756
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:13,252
This is an example of a product
that's using a recyclable label

757
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:17,047
for this flat plastic lid
that isn't recyclable.

And then we see what really happens to it.

This was a recycling facility
in Dresden, Germany,

We followed across Germany
to Antwerp, Belgium.

And Antwerp is the one that
waste traders like to use the most

ways around the rules.

990
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:42,352
We started talking to the exporters
and they'd say,

991
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:46,105
"Oh yeah, we get past Customs

1069
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:31,390
They imagine that "away"
to be something abstract.

1070
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:35,102
But for us, we're working on the ground.

1071
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,562
Away is here.

1072
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:43,486
I love designing, but I didn't really
get into styling until university.

1073
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:49,742
I kind of feel I don't have a fixed style.
I'm always experimenting.

1074
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:55,581
Ghana has an amazing history of design
and innovation and fashion.

1075
01:03:57,124 --> 01:04:02,004
But in the last ten years, clothing waste
has become a huge issue here.

1076
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:08,511
Many brands encourage people in Europe
and in the US to donate their old clothes.

1077
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,847
[woman 1] <i>I just decluttered my closet,</i>

1078
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,474
{\an8}<i>and I have two trash bags of clothes
I need to throw out.</i>

1079
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:17,019
{\an8}<i>If you bring in old clothes to H&M,
they use it for their recycling project.</i>

1080
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,730
<i>You get 15% off your next H&M purchase.</i>

1081
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:24,986
[Chloe] A lot of the donated clothing ends
up being exported to places like Ghana.

1082
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:29,448
The problem is, so many clothes are sent,

1083
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:32,118
and we have no way
to deal with this volume.

1084
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:38,332
So, often the clothing gets
dumped or washed by rains

1085
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:40,042
onto the local beaches.

1086
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:42,295
[man] Whoa.

1087
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,547
[laughs]

1088
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:45,715
Mountain.

1089
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,886
[Chloe] There is just
too much clothing coming in.

1090
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:55,600
We are what, like,
30 million people in Ghana?

1091
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:59,061
And you have 15 million pieces
coming in every week.

1092
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:12,533
[woman 2] <i>I'm going to stop blabbing,
and let's head into H&M.</i>

1093
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:16,329
[Roger] I would say that brands
have made people feel,

1094
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:17,914
"Wow, it's so cheap I can buy it."

1095
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:22,501
Even if it lasts a few washes,
it's still worth the money.

1096
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:27,506
[woman 3] <i>Let's unbox and try on
the new Barbie collection from Zara.</i>

1097
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:31,594
[Roger] From that point of view, the
brands changed the psyche of customers.

1098
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,848
But the brands don't really think about
the whole cycle, right?

1099
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,475
When you dispose, what happens?

1100
01:05:37,558 --> 01:05:39,602
And brands are not
responsible for that today.

1101
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:43,314
{\an8}<i>I placed a $500 SHEIN order.</i>

1102
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:47,485
[Roger] This a problem
that affects everyone on Earth.

1103
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:51,656
Polyester is a type of plastic
made from oil.

1104
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:53,908
{\an8}The biggest effect that
we're seeing right now

1105
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:56,786
{\an8}is that when you wash
synthetic polyester clothing,

1106
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:59,914
there's a lot of microplastics
that come out.

1107
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:02,792
And that actually enters
into the water system,

1108
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,585
and will come back into what we eat.

1109
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:10,800
[Eric] What we're finding
is that you're eating plastic.

1110
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,636
It's going into our deep lung tissue,

1111
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:15,680
that's crossing
into our blood cell membrane.

1112
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:19,725
If you look at them under a microscope,
they're sharp little materials

1113
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,061
that have hard edges,
which means they hit,

1114
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,748
and start to create inflammation
where you don't want inflammation,

1115
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:26,357
and leads to all sorts of disease.

1116
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:29,276
[man 1, in Spanish] <i>Guys,
I can't believe what I'm seeing.</i>

1117
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:30,945
[man 2] <i>Look, it's plastic.</i>

1118
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:32,571
- [man 1] Woah!
- [woman] <i>Look, man!</i>

1119
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:42,081
[Chloe] I know the brands.
They want people to be blind to

1120
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:44,000
what the reality is on the ground.

1121
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:47,753
Just stop. There's just
too much clothing in the world.

1122
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,505
Just fucking stop.

1123
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:04,716
[Jim] You might think,
"Well, I can look down the street."

1124
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:08,315
"I don't see, uh, you know,
waste everywhere."

1125
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:14,697
But our water,
our air is getting infected.

1126
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:21,203
These chemicals in our waste products

1127
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:25,583
don't just stay where they're put,
in landfills or dumps across the world.

1128
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:32,882
These are toxins that will leach out
into the environment.

1129
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:38,220
And ultimately cause
severe health problems.

1130
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:41,974
We are talking about
neurological disorders,

1131
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:45,978
cancer, serious chronic disease.

1132
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,064
[melancholy music playing]

1133
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:53,652
Waste is not something you can
sweep under a carpet anymore.

1134
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:56,280
And, uh, even though I think that

1135
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:59,658
a lot of people would've liked it
to stay hidden, it's not going to be.

1136
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,371
[Eric] The lesson is there's no way.

1137
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:07,249
It goes in the air, it goes in the ground,
it goes in the water.

1138
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,542
There's only three places.

1139
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:10,586
Pick your poison.

1140
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:17,218
I... I think the conversation around
my personal journey,

1141
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:19,553
is a "forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned" moment,

1142
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:23,849
looking back at what I did
within the fashion industry.

1143
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:30,773
When you looked at the increase in

1144
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:34,026
items you're selling per month,
per quarter, per year...

1145
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:39,323
it just becomes this...

1146
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:43,160
this, um, cycle of... of pain.

1147
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:50,292
That may be providing you and your family
with an ultimately lovely lifestyle,

1148
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:53,420
but you have to still reconcile that
with things that are important to you,

1149
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:55,214
um, as a... as a human being.

1150
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,973
You could only hide
from your complicit nature so long.

1151
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:11,689
So I respectfully, uh, stepped down
from my position at the end of 2019

1152
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:15,943
to put all my efforts
and all my energy, uh,

1153
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:19,113
for the rest of my life
into fixing some of the problems

1154
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:21,157
that I may have contributed to, or I did...

1155
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:24,243
I don't want to pussyfoot around.
I <i>did</i> contribute to.

<i>Learn to control them,

1190
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:30,202
I somehow, you know,
I got to that level of right

1191
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:33,622
where... where you would move
into that "executive" level,

1192
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:35,124
so, director and above,

1193
01:11:35,207 --> 01:11:36,750
and I saw the...

1194
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:42,715
the leveling guide for... [laughs]
to become a director, and it was one page.

1195
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:44,633
It was just like, basically, like,

1196
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,719
"Do you... you know,

1197
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:48,679
do you commit to...

1198
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,057
backing the company no matter what?"

1199
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:57,646
They wanna control the narrative,

1200
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,858
and they want to have
only one voice telling everybody

1201
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:03,110
the story that they want
everyone to believe.

1202
01:12:04,236 --> 01:12:05,696
So, "We are a climate company."

1203
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:08,365
"We are the best employer in the world."

1204
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:11,243
And they're very good
at that internal spin,

1205
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:15,497
and they don't want
anyone disrupting that story.

1206
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:20,127
[female reporter] <i>Amazon,
putting the planet front and center</i>

1207
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:24,423
{\an8}<i>after securing naming rights
to Seattle's KeyArena.</i>

1208
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:28,677
[Maren] Amazon's climate pledge
sounded great on paper.

1209
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:33,515
But they were only actually counting

1210
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:38,520
about 1% of the items they sold
in their carbon footprint calculations.

1211
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:43,400
And Amazon emissions
actually went up by 40%

1212
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:46,528
in the two years after
Jeff made his climate pledge.

1213
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:51,283
I felt like I was standing on
the right side of history, you know.

1214
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:56,288
We kept pushing and pushing
for more meaningful change,

1215
01:12:57,122 --> 01:12:59,958

01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:00,981
Sorry, I got a little geeky there,
but I love it.

1365
01:21:01,064 --> 01:21:04,067
We are gonna
need our electronics for sure.

1366
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:07,404
They're worth creating, but
we have to do it in a much smarter way.

1367
01:21:07,487 --> 01:21:10,782
This is actually my personal laptop.

1368
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,409
Take off the cover.

1369
01:21:12,492 --> 01:21:14,828
We've got the battery
right here on the bottom,

1370
01:21:14,911 --> 01:21:15,954
really easy to replace.

1371
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:18,206
Instead of it being glued together
and sealed up,

1372
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:20,458
it's all entirely repairable.

1373
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:24,754
<i>Say no to fast fashion,
say no to single-use items,</i>

1374
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:27,007
<i>water bottles, coffee cups,</i>

1375
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:28,717
<i>swag, all of it.</i>

1376
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,762
If you think you need something,
put it in your "online cart<i>,"</i>

1377
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:34,431
and leave it there for a month.

1378
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:39,102
And if you still want it after a month,
it might actually be something you need.

1379
01:21:39,185 --> 01:21:42,022
That's it. That's it.
Just... Just buy less.

1380
01:21:42,105 --> 01:21:43,440
It'll be fine.

1381
01:21:43,523 --> 01:21:46,109
Life is about the experiences
and the people that we're with.

1382
01:21:46,192 --> 01:21:48,528
The stuff we have supports it,
but it's not the end.

1383
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:50,113
It's not the objective.

1384
01:21:50,196 --> 01:21:53,199
Uh, whoever dies with
the most stuff does not win.
