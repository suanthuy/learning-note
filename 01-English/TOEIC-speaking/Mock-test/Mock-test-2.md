This picture was taken at a large clothing store. On the right side of the picture, there is a long clothing rack with men's attire. There's a woman in the middle of the picture who is looking at some of the items on the rack. She's wearing a long black coat and dark pants. Behind the woman, there is a small table with two horizontal handles, which may be for drawers. On the ceiling, there are large bright lights. In the background, you can see a small red-colored seat.

The image shows an indoor clothing store with a modern and stylish design. The store is well-organized, with various garments hanging neatly on racks. The clothes appear to be a mix of casual and formal wear, including shirts, jackets, and dresses. The racks are arranged in a way that allows customers to easily browse through the selection.

To the right side of the image, there is a person who seems to be examining or browsing through the clothes. This person is casually dressed and appears to be focused on finding something specific. The store is well-lit, with bright lighting fixtures on the ceiling that illuminate the space and highlight the clothing on display.

The overall atmosphere of the store is inviting and comfortable, making it an ideal place for customers to shop and explore the latest fashion trends.

This picture was taken at a produce store or grocery store. You can see a row of fruit on display for customers, such as oranges and plums. There are two people in this picture. One female customer is on the left and a tall man is on the right. He appears to be an employee of the grocery store. The woman looks like she just bought some produce and is receiving her change. In the background, there is a display of jars or jams or jellies.

The scene is set at a bustling fruit market stall. The stall is brimming with a colorful array of fruits, including oranges, apples, bananas, and possibly some other varieties in the background. The fruits are neatly arranged in baskets and crates, making them easily accessible to customers.

In the foreground, a transaction is taking place. A customer, whose face is not visible, is handing over money to the vendor. The vendor, also with their face obscured, stands behind a scale, ready to weigh the produce. The scale is a traditional type, adding a rustic charm to the scene.

The background of the image shows more shelves stocked with additional produce, indicating a well-supplied market. The overall atmosphere suggests a lively and vibrant market day, with fresh fruits on display and active commerce.

How many credit cards do you have and how often do you use them?

I only have one card and I think I use it nearly every day. I use it quite often because I don't like to carry lots of cash. Also it's very useful when I'm running out of cash.

What do you use your credit card for?

Well. Of course, I use it to pay for items I buy at stores or on the internet. I also use it to buy food every day. So my credit card is absolutely necessary in my daily life

How could your credit card service be improved?

Well. I think the security of credit cards should be improved. The reason is that if it's stolen. It can be used by strangers and cause a big problem for the owner. For example, I have a friend whose credit card was stolen recently and it was used to buy thousands of dollars worth of stuff. Therefore, I definitely wish that credit cards were safer.

Often there are problems when new computer systems are implemented. Something is going to be done about this, isn't it?

Sure, the IT team will review the performance of the system and handle all problems from Wednesday afternoon to Friday. Employees are welcome to express their opinion about changes then.

I'm supposed to go on a business trip on Tuesday and planning to be back on Wednesday afternoon. I'm worried about missing important system upgrades. Could you tell me the details of what's going to happen?

There will be three system upgrade schedules. First of all, on Tuesday Morning the IT department will upgrade the system. So employees will have to use alternative means of transportation. Following that, in the evening, live tests of the new in-house email system will be conducted. Finally, all employees will attend a tutorial on the new system on Wednesday morning.

Well. I agree with the idea that University students ought to work part-time to get prepared for the business world. The main reason is that working part-time teaches students important skills they will need in the future. For example, they can discover how to cooperate with their co-workers, finish tasks on time, deal with customers and so on. The other reason is that working part-time jobs help students plan their future career. What I mean is, through work experience, they can discover what sorts of work they like or dislike, as well as what they're good at. Therefore, I think it's a great idea for students to have various change chances to work part-time.
