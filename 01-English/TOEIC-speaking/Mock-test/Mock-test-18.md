## Question 11

What are some disadvantages of working from home compared to working in the office?

There are several disadvantages of working from home. First, it is inconvenient. If I want to discuss something with my colleagues, I can not get their feedback immediately. Second, it's difficult to focus on work when working from home. There are too many distractions such as family member, neighbors or household chores.

Let me tell you my story. Last year, due to the pandemic, I had to work from home. I could't concentrate on my work because of my noisy children. Therefore, I felt that I was less productive. That's why I think that working from home is a bad idea.
