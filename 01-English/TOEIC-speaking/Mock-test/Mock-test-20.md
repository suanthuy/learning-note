A good place to visit in my area is Do Son beach. It is 10 Km from the bus station. I often go to Do Son beach with my family.

Well, I think the good place to visit my area is park named Pac Bo. It is about 100 meters away from the bus station.

I think you should go to the shopping mall. Because there are some souvenir stores there. They offer a variety of items and they have good customer service. Moreover, the prices are really reasonable. I bet that you will find your idea souvenir for your friend if you go there.

## Question 11

Do you prefer to eat out at restaurants or to eat at home? Support your answer with reasons or examples.

> restaurant
>
> convenient: go shopping, cook, clean
>
> try many different dishes: require a lot of/ rare ingredients, cooking process is complicated

> home
>
> cleaner: make sure that ... refresh and clean ingredients
>
> save money, eat, spend 100

I prefer to eat out at restaurants for several reasons. Firstly, it is much more convenient. This is because when I eat at restaurant, I just need to go there, make an order and wait for the food to be serve. Compare it to cook at home, I have to go shopping ingredients, prepare and cook the meal and clean after that. Secondly, I can try many different dishes if I eat at the restaurants. There are a lot of dishes that require rare ingredients. All the cooking process is complicated. So it is difficult to cook them at home. Therefore, I want to try that at the restaurants. That's why I think so.

I prefer to eat at home for several reasons. Firstly, it is cleaner. When cooking at home, I make sure that all the ingredients I use are fresh and clean. However, when you eat out at the restaurants, you rarely see them cook or see them shopping. So, it hard for you to know where are the ingredients or they are use fresh or not. Secondly, I can save money if I eat at home. For example, when I and my friends come over to have a hot pot. We only need to pay one hundred thousand VND. But if we go to restaurant, It will cost two hundred thousand VND. That's why I think so.
