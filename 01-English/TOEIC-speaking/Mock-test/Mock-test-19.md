## Question 11

Do you think it's important to spend time outdoors?

Yes, I think that it's important to spend time outdoors. First, it helps people stay heathy. This is because they can enjoy fresh air and move their bodies when they go out. Second, it helps people to expand their relationship. When going out, they can meet and make friends with a lot of people. When I was small, I was very shy. I stayed at home all the time and never went out. As a result, I felt very lonely. One day, my mother signed me up for a swimming class. I met a lot of friends here and I also became healthier. This made me realize that spending time outdoor is very important.
