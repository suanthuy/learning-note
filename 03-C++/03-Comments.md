# C++ Comments

Comments in C++ are meant to explain the code as well as to make it more readable. Their purpose is to provide information about code lines. When testing alternative code, they can also be used to prevent execution of some part of the code. Programmers commonly use comments to document their work.

## Type of Comments in C++

In C++ there are two types of comments:

-   Single-line comment
-   Multi-line comment

### Single-line comment

In C++, single line comments are represented as // double forward slash. It applies comments to a single line only. The compiler ignores any text after // and it will not be executed.

### Multi-line comment

A multi-line comment can occupy many lines of code, it starts with /\* and ends with \*/, but it cannot be nested. Any text between /\* and \*/ will be ignored by the compiler.
