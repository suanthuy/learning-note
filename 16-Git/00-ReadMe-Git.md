# Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is lightning fast and has a huge ecosystem of GUIs, hosting services, and command-line tools.

## GitHub / GitLab

Github and GitLab is a server that allow you to upload and download the source code. Simplely, GitHub and GitLab is a cloud service that store the public or private source code.

## The Three States

Git has three main states that your files can reside in: modified, staged and committed.

    - Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.
    - Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.
    - Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.

The basic Git workflow goes something like this:
    1. You modify files in your working tree.
    2. You selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit, which adds only those changes to the staging area.
    3. You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores the snapshot permanently to your Git directory.
