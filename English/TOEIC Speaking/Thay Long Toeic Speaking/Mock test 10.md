00:10:29.880 at Windham University you definitely do
00:10:33.240 not want to meet this seminar as it will

00:10:37.740 topics
00:10:40.380 in this part of the test you will give
00:10:42.480 your opinion about a specific topic
00:10:45.000 be sure to say as much as you can in the
00:10:47.220 time allowed
00:10:48.420 you will have 30 seconds to prepare
00:10:51.180 then you will have 60 seconds to speak
00:10:53.459 would you prefer to own your house or
00:10:55.800 rent one
00:10:56.940 use specific reasons and details to
00:10:59.519 support opinion
00:11:02.100 begin preparing now
00:11:35.399 begin speaking now there is no doubt in
00:11:39.180 my mind that owning a house is better
00:11:41.519 than renting I feel this way for two
00:11:44.279 main reasons most importantly owning a
00:11:47.640 house is a wise Financial investment
00:11:49.920 house prices usually rise considerably
00:11:52.920 over time so the value of your
00:11:55.560 investment increases if you rent a house
00:11:58.200 you have to pay a lot of money every
00:12:00.300 month and that money is gone forever
00:12:02.579 even if you paid rent for 50 years you
00:12:06.240 still would not own the property so it's
00:12:08.399 complete waste of money not only that if
00:12:11.519 you rent the landlord can add ask you to
00:12:14.459 leave at any time that's very
00:12:16.140 inconvenient especially if you work
00:12:18.480 nearby or have children attending a
00:12:20.640 local school therefore my preference is
00:12:23.880 to buy rather than rent if I can afford
00:12:26.820 to do so
