Now there is no doubt in my mind that owning a house is better than renting I feel this way for two main reasons most importantly owning a house is a wise Financial investment house prices usually rise considerably over time so the value of your investment increases if you rent a house you have to pay a lot of money every month and that money is gone forever even if you paid rent for 50 years you still would not own the property so it's complete waste of money not only that if you rent the landlord can add ask you to leave at any time that's very inconvenient especially if you work nearby or have children attending a local school therefore my preference is to buy rather than rent if I can afford to do so
