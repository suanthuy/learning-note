00:11:14.399 opinion begin preparing
00:11:27.959 now
00:11:48.880 begin speaking
00:11:51.160 now well I agree that children should
00:11:54.320 not be allowed to use cell phones at
00:11:56.800 school for the following reasons first
00:11:59.680 of all it can be a major distraction in
00:12:02.519 school for example when students send
00:12:05.959 text messages to one another in class
00:12:08.880 the sounds of phones be being all
00:12:11.279 vibrating make it difficult for students
00:12:14.079 and teachers to concentrate another
00:12:17.279 reason is that cell phones discourage
00:12:19.760 children from being social for instance
00:12:23.120 with the Advent of the smartphones many
00:12:25.880 children spend more time playing with
00:12:28.199 their phones than spending time with
00:12:30.440 friends for this reason I believe
00:12:33.120 children should not be allowed to use
00:12:35.199 selfness School
