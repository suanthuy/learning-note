Well I don't think that any harm in buying jewelry online as long as you do some careful research before buying anything. I'm buying from a reputable online jewelry store is probably the cheapest most convenient way to get jewelry these days.

00:10:20.040 Some people prefer to work in a group
00:10:22.260 While others prefer to work alone
00:10:24.779 which do you prefer and why begin
00:10:27.360 preparing now
00:10:59.060 begin speaking now
00:11:01.760 well I would much rather work in a group
00:11:05.279 one main reason is that I don't have
00:11:08.160 another person there pushing me then I
00:11:11.339 get distracted too easily often I have
00:11:14.760 projects to do alone but can't get
00:11:17.760 started or can't stay working on them
00:11:20.700 consistently
00:11:22.140 so I get distracted and wander up to
00:11:25.079 complete another task
00:11:26.760 the other main reason why I like working
00:11:29.700 with a group is that I find it much
00:11:33.120 easier to brainstorm for ideas when you
00:11:36.360 have several people with different
00:11:38.160 personalities and all talking together
00:11:41.040 and trying to figure out I really enjoy
00:11:44.700 having someone else to talk and modeling
00:11:47.279 over different ideas and thoughts to see
00:11:50.940 what can work or what can't work for
00:11:54.899 such reason I prefer to work in a group
