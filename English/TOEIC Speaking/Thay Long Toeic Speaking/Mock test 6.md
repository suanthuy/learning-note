00:07:27.419 do you prefer to watch movies on the
00:07:29.340 computer or go to a movie theater
00:07:31.680 why

00:07:41.400 I prefer to watch movies on the computer
00:07:44.160 the biggest reason is that I am too busy
00:07:47.340 and it's hot to fight time to go to the
00:07:50.340 movie theater so I download some of some
00:07:55.020 of the films I don't want to miss on my
00:07:57.479 computer and watch them on my way home
00:08:00.180 on the bus

00:11:59.339 begin speaking now well when I go on a
00:12:03.120 trip I usually do not make any plans I
00:12:06.120 am a spontaneous kind of person and a
00:12:09.060 fight that like to be surprised about
00:12:11.459 the interesting places and activities
00:12:13.980 available on my vacation well I went to
00:12:17.399 Ho Chi Minh City last spring with a
00:12:19.680 friend neither of us made any plans but
00:12:22.740 we had the best time of our lives we met
00:12:25.500 up with some other vocationals and
00:12:27.720 enjoyed some of the tours that they had
00:12:30.000 booked my friend and I did not
00:12:33.079 waste time researching about what to do
00:12:36.240 we relied on the suggestions of others
00:12:39.120 and we were never disappointed I think
00:12:42.000 that personal accounts are more
00:12:44.360 substantial than a brochure or Internet
00:12:46.980 information that would be available if
00:12:49.800 we were to plan my trip precisely also
00:12:54.720 on some days I just want to relax and do
00:12:57.540 nothing hence I don't bother making
00:13:01.579 precise plans and prefer to do whatever
00:13:04.560 I feel like doing
