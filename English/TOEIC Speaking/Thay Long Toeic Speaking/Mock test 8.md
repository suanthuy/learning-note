00:04:18.000 this picture was taken at a busy office
00:04:20.459 the main focus of the picture is many
00:04:23.040 employees concentrating on their work
00:04:25.620 the woman on the left is looking over a
00:04:28.380 man's shoulders and he seems to be
00:04:30.900 showing her something on his monitor
00:04:33.080 beside them there is a woman talking on
00:04:35.699 the phone and using the computer at the
00:04:38.160 same time next to her is another woman
00:04:40.500 sitting and talking to the man who's
00:04:42.840 leaning over her desk overall I guess it
00:04:46.199 looks like a typical scene of the office

00:05:40.680 this picture was taken at a barbecue
00:05:43.139 party Outdoors the main focus of the
00:05:45.600 picture is a group of people attending
00:05:47.940 the party the man on the left is serving
00:05:50.580 the barbecue holding a cooking utensil
00:05:53.340 in one hand the others are enjoying the
00:05:56.340 food and gossiping about something
00:05:58.020 together next to him in the background I
00:06:01.380 can also find a deep blue sky without
00:06:04.139 any clouds overall I get it looks like a
00:06:07.500 casual party among close friend close
00:06:09.780 friends

00:06:37.620 which department store do you usually go
00:06:39.720 to
00:06:40.560 begin preparing now
00:06:46.560 begin speaking now
00:06:49.560 um I usually go to the ABC departments
00:06:52.440 store downtown that's because it has all
00:06:55.500 the best shops and products therefore it
00:06:58.860 is always crowded with lots of customers
00:07:06.360 how much money do you normally spend on
00:07:08.400 a trip to the department store

![](./Images/mock-test-8-5.png)

00:07:18.680 I think I usually spend around one
00:07:22.460 million Vietnam dong at the department
00:07:25.380 store but the amount differs depending
00:07:28.259 on the situation sometimes I just go
00:07:31.020 window shopping and buy nothing
00:07:36.240 do you think large chain departments are
00:07:38.220 bad for local businesses

![](./Images/mock-test-8-6.png)

00:07:49.139 well actually I think large chain
00:07:51.840 department stores are good for local
00:07:54.120 businesses that's because they attract
00:07:57.599 lots of customers to the area it is true
00:08:01.020 that customers spend most of their money
00:08:03.780 at the department store however many
00:08:06.780 people still buy things at local shops
00:08:09.780 and eat out at coffee shops and
00:08:11.940 restaurants in the area
00:08:13.740 Source I definitely think
00:08:16.500 having a big department store nearby is
00:08:19.500 good for the surrounding local stores

00:09:34.440 what date exactly is the flight on and
00:09:36.779 what's the flight number
00:09:39.420 begin preparing now
00:09:45.480 again speaking now
00:09:47.240 while your flight will be on September
00:09:50.220 27th and the flight number is kj-56 the
00:09:54.839 flight will be departing at 1 40 pm and
00:09:58.560 will be arriving in Charlotte at 205 pm
00:10:03.839 as far as I remember the baggage weight
00:10:05.940 limit is 60 pounds
00:10:08.220 is that right

![](./Images/mock-test-8-8.png)

00:10:41.580 when should I tell them to come
00:10:44.940 begin preparing now
00:10:46.860 foreign
00:10:51.019 speaking now
00:10:53.339 well your flight leaves at Boston at
00:10:56.760 Terminal 1 at 1 40 PM local time but you
00:11:00.959 should arrive at the airport at least
00:11:03.000 one hour prior to the scheduled takeoff
00:11:06.300 time after 1 hour and 25 minute flight
00:11:09.839 you arrive in Charlotte at 205 PM local
00:11:14.220 time there so you need to be picked up
00:11:16.680 soon after that your arrival gate is in
00:11:19.920 terminal 3.

![](./Images/mock-test-8-9.png)

00:10:18.180 well I'm afraid not the standard baggage
00:10:21.420 allowance is 50 pounds however if you
00:10:25.560 are a member of the Khal Airways club
00:10:29.220 you will be able to take 60 pounds of
00:10:32.279 baggage at no extra costs
00:10:36.060 I'm arranging to have someone to pick me
00:10:37.980 up and drop me off at the airport in
00:10:39.779 Boston and Charlotte

00:12:24.779 well I totally agree with the idea that
00:12:28.019 most successful people are well
00:12:30.180 organized the main reason is that people
00:12:32.760 who are organized
00:12:35.360 prioritize tasks that helps them to meet
00:12:39.300 their objectives more efficiently for
00:12:42.660 example if you have a specific plan of
00:12:46.019 what to do you'll get right down to the
00:12:48.660 work and save time and energy the other
00:12:51.779 reason is that organized people know how
00:12:54.779 to stay focused on the project until it
00:12:58.800 is finished properly in my experience
00:13:02.540 disorganized people have a lot of
00:13:05.220 difficulty staying disciplined and
00:13:08.279 following through the tasks this makes
00:13:11.519 it much harder for them to meet
00:13:13.500 important deadlines that's why I
00:13:16.019 definitely think that most successful
00:13:18.060 people are well organized
