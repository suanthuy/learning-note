00:06:14.520 question 5 and 6 and 30 seconds to

00:06:21.120 research in your country
00:06:23.100 you have agreed to participate in a
00:06:25.259 telephone interview about perfume
00:06:27.960 when do you usually put on perfume begin
00:06:31.020 preparing now
00:06:36.419 begin speaking now
00:06:39.960 um I usually put perfume on before I go
00:06:42.660 out on a date or go clubbing I do it
00:06:45.720 because I want to make a good
00:06:47.220 Impressions on the others on others
00:06:54.539 do you like to receive perfume as a gift
00:06:57.300 begin preparing now
00:07:03.539 again speaking now
00:07:06.120 well personally I I don't because I'm
00:07:09.120 quite picky they are only a limited
00:07:12.419 number of buffoon brands that I like so
00:07:15.419 I prefer buying it by by myself rather
00:07:18.660 than getting it as a gift
00:07:22.620 what are the things you consider when
00:07:24.539 buying perfume
00:07:26.520 begin preparing now
00:07:33.000 speaking now
00:07:35.039 um well the main thing I consider is
00:07:37.259 that I want to to make sure the sun is
00:07:40.440 mild the reason is that there's nothing
00:07:43.259 worse than standing next to someone
00:07:45.599 wearing
00:07:47.940 um overpowering the film especially I
00:07:51.300 hate being with someone wearing strong
00:07:54.060 perfume in a small space like an
00:07:57.720 elevator therefore whenever I buy
00:08:00.419 perfume I always choose the
00:08:03.900 um one with a mild scent
00:08:06.900 in this part of the test you will answer
00:08:09.060 three questions based on the information

00:09:17.580 tomorrow's schedule
00:09:19.380 begin preparing now
00:09:25.440 begin speaking now
00:09:29.459 um you're going to visit the Brooks
00:09:31.860 preening house at nine in the morning
00:09:33.839 and there you will discuss the brochure
00:09:37.200 layout with the head designer
00:09:45.000 as far as I know the monthly lunch
00:09:47.040 meeting is scheduled tomorrow
00:09:49.320 it will be in the conference won't it
00:09:52.380 begin preparing now
00:09:58.620 begin speaking now
00:10:00.899 I'm afraid that's incorrect the
00:10:03.899 executive lunch meeting is taking place
00:10:06.300 at La vitella Italian cuisine however
00:10:10.980 its subject to change and will be
00:10:13.140 confirmed by 11 AM tomorrow
00:10:18.300 I think I need to stop by the bank
00:10:19.980 sometime after lunch tomorrow so could
00:10:22.260 you tell me the details of the afternoon
00:10:23.760 schedule so that I can find some time
00:10:25.680 for that
00:10:27.480 begin preparing now
00:10:33.480 begin speaking now
00:10:36.360 certainly there are three tasks you for
00:10:40.200 you to do the first thing you will do is
00:10:42.779 have a video conference with the
00:10:45.000 regional director at 1 30 pm
00:10:48.300 after that you're scheduled to attend a
00:10:51.480 seminar on time management hosted by HR
00:10:55.800 Manager last you have to go to the
00:10:58.860 foreman Event Center to attend a
00:11:01.620 corporate drinks and dinner function
00:11:05.360 in this part of the test you will give
00:11:07.920 your opinion about a specific topic
00:11:10.440 be sure to say as much as you can in the
00:11:12.660 time allowed
00:11:13.860 you will have 30 seconds to prepare
00:11:16.680 then you will have 60 seconds to speak
00:11:20.040 some people like to check out movie
00:11:21.540 reviews before going to the theater
00:11:24.120 others feel that it isn't necessary
00:11:26.820 what do you think and why
00:11:29.040 include specific reasons and examples to
00:11:31.800 support your opinion
00:11:34.500 begin preparing now
00:12:07.800 begin speaking now foreign
00:12:10.620 well in my case I tried to avoid reviews
00:12:13.860 before going to see a movie that's
00:12:17.160 because reviews give away important
00:12:20.279 information about the plot which we call
00:12:23.339 movie spoilers for example before
00:12:26.459 watching impossible mission I read a
00:12:29.339 review which gave away the surprising
00:12:31.740 ending it totally ruined the movie for
00:12:34.980 me another thing is that reviews
00:12:37.459 influence our
00:12:39.839 or your opinion of a movie before you've
00:12:44.160 even seen it by reading movie reviews
00:12:46.880 beforehand you already get a negative or
00:12:50.639 positive impression of it even worse a
00:12:54.180 lot of movie productions are posting
00:12:57.019 favorable reviews as part of their
00:12:59.940 marketing strategy
00:13:01.620 that's why I normally do not check movie
00:13:04.440 reviews before I actually watch it
00:13:09.180 foreign
