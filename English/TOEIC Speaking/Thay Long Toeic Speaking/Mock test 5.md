00:04:16.019 Market in the foreground you can see a
00:04:18.238 man selling some small items it's hard
00:04:21.238 to make out exactly what they are but I
00:04:23.520 think they might be chess boards and
00:04:26.160 pieces in the middle of the picture
00:04:28.500 there are stalls and a lot of people are
00:04:30.840 browsing through them people are busy
00:04:34.139 examining the goods for sale and also
00:04:36.840 some umbrellas have been put up because
00:04:39.900 it's a hot and sunny day thank you

00:05:34.139 this picture shows some customers
00:05:36.479 sitting in a cafe the first thing I can
00:05:39.000 see in this picture is a young couple
00:05:41.280 sitting by the window the couple is
00:05:44.160 engaged in conversation and they're
00:05:46.440 wearing casual clothes on the right
00:05:48.900 another couple is sitting by the wall
00:05:51.479 and talking on the left there's a guy
00:05:53.880 sitting by himself and using his laptop
00:05:56.580 computer overall it looks like a trendy
00:05:59.520 and stylish coffee shop

![](./Images/mock-test-5-6.png)

00:06:23.100 you have agreed to participate in a
00:06:25.259 telephone interview about perfume
00:06:27.960 when do you usually put on perfume begin

00:06:39.960 um I usually put perfume on before I go
00:06:42.660 out on a date or go clubbing I do it
00:06:45.720 because I want to make a good
00:06:47.220 Impressions on the others on others

![](./Images/mock-test-5-7.png)


00:06:54.539 do you like to receive perfume as a gift
00:06:57.300 begin preparing now
00:07:03.539 again speaking now
00:07:06.120 well personally I I don't because I'm
00:07:09.120 quite picky they are only a limited
00:07:12.419 number of buffoon brands that I like so
00:07:15.419 I prefer buying it by by myself rather
00:07:18.660 than getting it as a gift

![](./Images/mock-test-5-8.png)

00:07:22.620 what are the things you consider when
00:07:24.539 buying perfume
00:07:26.520 begin preparing now
00:07:33.000 speaking now
00:07:35.039 um well the main thing I consider is
00:07:37.259 that I want to to make sure the sun is
00:07:40.440 mild the reason is that there's nothing
00:07:43.259 worse than standing next to someone
00:07:45.599 wearing
00:07:47.940 um overpowering the film especially I
00:07:51.300 hate being with someone wearing strong
00:07:54.060 perfume in a small space like an
00:07:57.720 elevator therefore whenever I buy
00:08:00.419 perfume I always choose the
00:08:03.900 um one with a mild scent

![](./Images/mock-test-5-9.png)

00:09:15.120 foreign what the first thing on
00:09:17.580 tomorrow's schedule
00:09:19.380 begin preparing now
00:09:25.440 begin speaking now
00:09:29.459 um you're going to visit the Brooks
00:09:31.860 preening house at nine in the morning
00:09:33.839 and there you will discuss the brochure
00:09:37.200 layout with the head designer
00:09:45.000 as far as I know the monthly lunch
00:09:47.040 meeting is scheduled tomorrow
00:09:49.320 it will be in the conference won't it

![](./Images/mock-test-5-10.png)

00:10:00.899 I'm afraid that's incorrect the
00:10:03.899 executive lunch meeting is taking place
00:10:06.300 at La vitella Italian cuisine however
00:10:10.980 its subject to change and will be
00:10:13.140 confirmed by 11 AM tomorrow
00:10:18.300 I think I need to stop by the bank
00:10:19.980 sometime after lunch tomorrow so could
00:10:22.260 you tell me the details of the afternoon
00:10:23.760 schedule so that I can find some time
00:10:25.680 for that

![](./Images/mock-test-5-11.png)

00:10:36.360 certainly there are three tasks you for
00:10:40.200 you to do the first thing you will do is
00:10:42.779 have a video conference with the
00:10:45.000 regional director at 1 30 pm
00:10:48.300 after that you're scheduled to attend a
00:10:51.480 seminar on time management hosted by HR

00:12:10.620 well in my case I tried to avoid reviews
00:12:13.860 before going to see a movie that's
00:12:17.160 because reviews give away important
00:12:20.279 information about the plot which we call
00:12:23.339 movie spoilers for example before
00:12:26.459 watching impossible mission I read a
00:12:29.339 review which gave away the surprising
00:12:31.740 ending it totally ruined the movie for
00:12:34.980 me another thing is that reviews
00:12:37.459 influence our
00:12:39.839 or your opinion of a movie before you've
00:12:44.160 even seen it by reading movie reviews
00:12:46.880 beforehand you already get a negative or
00:12:50.639 positive impression of it even worse a
00:12:54.180 lot of movie productions are posting
00:12:57.019 favorable reviews as part of their
00:12:59.940 marketing strategy
00:13:01.620 that's why I normally do not check movie
00:13:04.440 reviews before I actually watch it
00:13:09.180 foreign
