00:04:02.099 this picture was taken in a classroom
00:04:04.799 some people who seem to be students are
00:04:07.920 in a group discussing something a woman
00:04:10.439 on the right is holding a red photo and
00:04:13.319 gesturing I think she's giving a lecture
00:04:16.560 or an explanation to the class next to
00:04:19.978 her a man in a blue sweater is folding
00:04:23.280 his arms and looking at the lecture the
00:04:27.000 rest of the students are also looking at
00:04:29.340 her and listening carefully

00:05:23.699 this is a picture of a food vendor
00:05:26.580 preparing a meal on the left a man in a
00:05:29.759 red jacket seems to be buying some bread
00:05:32.220 there are two people on the right side
00:05:34.919 of the picture one is pointing at the
00:05:37.860 bender and the other is carrying
00:05:40.199 something on his shoulder two motorbikes
00:05:43.080 are parked in front of the shop I can
00:05:46.199 see a few men passing by in the back the
00:05:49.199 people look busy so I guess this picture
00:05:51.479 was taken in the morning

00:06:45.720 what's your favorite restaurant and why

00:06:28.560 well I ate out at a Chinese restaurant
00:06:31.919 with my parents last Sunday we had
00:06:35.100 noodles with black bean salt and sweet
00:06:37.740 and sour pork which is the most popular
00:06:40.380 Chinese food in Vietnam

![](./Images/mock-test-4-7.png)

00:06:57.180 actually the Western I like the best is
00:07:00.180 a little Japanese place downtown that
00:07:03.060 specialize in raw fish and Sushi I like
00:07:07.259 that place because it is fresh
00:07:10.020 ingredients and its prices are
00:07:12.660 reasonable

![](./Images/mock-test-4-8.png)

00:07:14.400 what factors influence decision when you
00:07:16.860 choose a restaurant

00:07:26.539 while the two main factors I consider
00:07:29.940 when choosing a restaurant are
00:07:32.099 healthiness and cost First I don't eat a
00:07:36.120 restaurant that is a lot of artificial
00:07:38.940 seasonings or too much salt as is very
00:07:42.599 unhealthy furthermore I hate spending
00:07:45.660 too much money when dining out because I
00:07:48.660 have a tight budget therefore I think
00:07:51.539 it's important to check whether the
00:07:54.000 restaurant serves healthy food at a
00:07:56.280 reasonable price

00:12:03.480 well I agree that an employee's
00:12:06.360 performance appraisal should be based
00:12:09.180 many of the managers evaluation the main
00:12:12.660 reason is that the manager is in the
00:12:15.240 best position to assess a worker
00:12:17.880 performance I mean managers aside and
00:12:21.300 monitor employees work directly
00:12:23.480 therefore they know how quickly and
00:12:26.100 effectively employees perform tasks in
00:12:29.399 addition managers are the best people to
00:12:32.459 give the detailed and constructive
00:12:34.680 feedback to employees performance
00:12:37.560 appraisals should also aim to improve
00:12:40.200 employees skills and considering
00:12:42.839 managers managers of work experience
00:12:45.600 they are able to provide workers with
00:12:48.600 informative feedback for these reasons I
00:12:52.139 think it's a great idea to allow
00:12:54.240 managers to evaluate their employees
00:12:56.880 performance
00:13:00.480 foreign
