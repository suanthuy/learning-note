This picture was taken in an auditorium. People are sitting on red and white seats facing the stage. On the stage, there is a man looks like he is addressing the audience. In the background, I can see an upper level of seating in the auditorium, where more people are sitting. There are various spotlights in the ceiling of the auditorium and there seems to be a screen of the wall of the stage. The auditorium looks comfortable and well equipped.

The picture was taken in a quiet street. There are two people walking away in the distance only one of whom is really invisible. The man is wearing blue short and grey sleeveless shirt. He seems to be carrying a bag. These are cars parked on the right hand side of the road. Both sides of the road are lined with tall streetlights. The street looks calm and peaceful as there is no traffic and the man is working in the road.

Working conditions would be better if people felt able to leave work on time. In some companies, people think that they shouldn't live work until their boss leaves. This can mean that people are just waiting in the office, even though they have finished all their work.

If I have some free time I would choose hiking from these three options. I like hiking for two simple reasons. Firstly hiking gives me a really good opportunity to think through things. I can breathe fresh air in the forest, and this helps me to relax and think more clearly. Once, I begin hiking with a lot of stress, worrying about a family problem. But by the time, I was finished, I had a brilliant solution in mind, and I was completely stress free. Not only that, but hiking is also excellent exercise. Hiking up on actual mountains is very physically demanding, so it is effective for strengthening my muscles and increasing my stamina. I find that hiking for a few hours is much more effective than doing muscle training at the gym. Therefore, I would go hiking during my spare time.

Of these three options, I think I would choose to read a book. My main reason is that books allow me to experience things that I might never have a opportunity to experience firsthand. This includes things that are not currently possible, like traveling to other worlds or through time. Of course, movies do the same thing, but with a book I use my own imagination, while with a movie I watch someone else do it. My second reason for choosing a book is that it is very convenient. Since books are light and durable, they are easy to carry. I can read books anywhere. So when I have free time, I prefer to read a book.
