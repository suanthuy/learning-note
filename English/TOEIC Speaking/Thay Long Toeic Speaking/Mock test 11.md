00:06:44.819 longer though

00:07:25.319 working conditions would be better if
00:07:28.259 people felt able to live work on time in
00:07:31.560 some companies people think that they
00:07:34.319 shouldn't live work until their boss
00:07:36.180 leaves this can mean that people are

00:10:27.779 you will have 30 seconds to prepare
00:10:30.600 then you will have 60 seconds to speak
00:10:32.820 which of the following three things
00:10:34.800 would you do if you had some free time
00:10:37.500 choose one of the options and use
00:10:39.540 specific reasons and details to support
00:10:41.580 your opinion
00:10:43.980 begin preparing now
00:11:17.399 begin speaking now
00:11:21.120 if I have some free time I would choose
00:11:23.760 hiking from these three options I like
00:11:26.519 hiking for two simple reasons firstly
00:11:29.579 hiking gives me a really good
00:11:31.980 opportunity to think through things
00:11:34.920 I can breathe fresh air in the forest
00:11:37.620 and this helps me to relax and think
00:11:40.560 more clearly once I begin hiking with a
00:11:44.519 lot of stress worrying about a family
00:11:47.220 problem but by the time I was finished I
00:11:50.339 had a brilliant solution in mind and I
00:11:52.680 was completely stress free not only that
00:11:55.500 but hiking is also excellent exercise
00:11:58.220 hiking up on actual mountains is very
00:12:01.620 physically demanding so it is effective
00:12:04.680 for strengthening my muscles and
00:12:07.140 increasing my stamina
00:12:09.000 I find that hiking for a few hours is
00:12:12.000 much more effective than doing muscle
00:12:14.459 training at the gym therefore I would go
00:12:17.579 hiking during my spare time
00:12:20.959 of these three options I think I would
00:12:24.180 choose to read a book my main reason is
00:12:26.880 that books allow me to experience things
00:12:29.339 that I might never have a opportunity to
00:12:32.760 experience firsthand
00:12:34.860 this includes things that are not
00:12:37.320 currently possible like traveling to
00:12:40.019 other worlds or Through Time Of course
00:12:43.019 movies do the same thing but with a book
00:12:45.600 I use my own imagination while with a
00:12:48.899 movie I watch someone else do it my
00:12:52.200 second reason for choosing a book is
00:12:54.779 that it is very convenient
00:12:56.880 since books are light and durable they
00:13:00.300 are easy to carry I can read books
00:13:02.880 anywhere so when I have free time I
00:13:05.760 prefer to read a book
