00:03:57.599 this picture was taken at a large
00:04:00.000 clothing store on the right side of the
00:04:02.340 picture there is a long clothing rack
00:04:04.860 with men's attire there's a woman in the
00:04:07.980 middle of the picture who is looking at
00:04:10.439 some of the items on the rack she's
00:04:13.200 wearing a long black coat and dark pants
00:04:16.380 Behind The woman there is a small table
00:04:19.139 with two horizontal handles which may be
00:04:22.380 for draws on the sailing there are a lot
00:04:25.199 bright lights and in the background you

00:05:19.320 this picture was taken at a grocery
00:05:21.660 store you can see a row of fruit on
00:05:25.020 display for customers such as oranges
00:05:27.780 and plumens there are two people in this

00:06:15.840 how many credit cards do you have and
00:06:17.820 how often do you use them begin

00:06:28.259 I only have one card and I think I use
00:06:31.020 it nearly every day I use it quite often
00:06:34.440 because I don't like to carry lots of
00:06:36.720 cash also it's very useful when I'm
00:06:39.600 running out of cash

![](./Images/mock-test-2-8.png)

00:06:44.340 what do you use your credit card for

00:06:56.160 well of course I use it to pay for items
00:06:59.280 I buy at stores or on the internet I
00:07:02.819 also use it to buy food every day so my
00:07:06.240 credit card is absolutely necessary in
00:07:09.000 my daily life

![](./Images/mock-test-2-9.png)

00:07:13.639 how could your credit card service be
00:07:15.960 improved

00:07:25.199 well I think the security of credit
00:07:27.479 cards should be improved the reason is
00:07:30.479 that if it's stolen it can be used by
00:07:33.720 strangers and cause a big problem for
00:07:36.539 the owner for example I have a friend
00:07:39.780 who's
00:07:41.060 was host credit card was stolen recently
00:07:44.460 and it was used to buy thousands of
00:07:48.180 dollars worth of stuff therefore I
00:07:51.360 definitely wish that credit cards were
00:07:55.020 safer

00:09:05.959 Can employees access the current email
00:09:08.580 system

00:09:19.800 the current in-house email network will
00:09:22.680 be taken offline on Monday evening so
00:09:26.040 employees will be able to use the old
00:09:28.440 system until then
00:09:35.760 often there are problems when new
00:09:37.740 computer systems are implemented
00:09:40.260 something is going to be done about this
00:09:42.120 isn't it

![](./Images/mock-test-2-11.png)

00:09:51.959 sure the IT team will review the
00:09:54.899 performance of the system and handle all
00:09:57.959 problems from Wednesday afternoon to
00:10:00.660 Friday employees are welcome to express
00:10:03.720 their opinion about changes then
00:10:08.519 I'm supposed to go on a business trip on
00:10:10.680 Tuesday and planning to be back on
00:10:12.300 Wednesday afternoon

![](./Images/mock-test-2-12.png)

00:10:13.920 I'm worried about missing important
00:10:15.720 system upgrades
00:10:17.399 could you tell me the details of what's
00:10:19.080 going to happen begin preparing now

00:10:28.980 there will be three system upgrade
00:10:31.500 schedules first of all on Tuesday
00:10:34.200 Morning the IT department will upgrade
00:10:37.560 the system so employees will have to use
00:10:40.580 alternative means of transportation
00:10:44.220 following that in the evening live tests
00:10:47.579 of the new in-house email system will be
00:10:50.700 conducted
00:10:51.839 finally all employees will attend a
00:10:55.260 tutorial on the new system on Wednesday
00:10:57.779 morning

00:12:01.980 well I agree with the idea that
00:12:05.220 University students out to work
00:12:07.260 part-time to get prepared for the
00:12:09.600 business world the main reason is that
00:12:12.120 working part-time teaches students
00:12:14.760 important skills they will need in the
00:12:17.279 future
00:12:18.180 for example they can discover how to
00:12:21.540 cooperate with their co-workers finish
00:12:25.079 tasks on time deal with customers and so
00:12:29.399 on
00:12:30.300 the other reason is that working
00:12:32.519 part-time jobs help students plan their
00:12:36.240 future career
00:12:37.920 what I mean is through work experience
00:12:40.620 they can discover what sorts of work
00:12:43.620 they like or dislike as well as what
00:12:47.339 they're good at
00:12:48.779 therefore I think it's a great idea for
00:12:51.720 students to have various change chances
00:12:55.139 to work part-time
