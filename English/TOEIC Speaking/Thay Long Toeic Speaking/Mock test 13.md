yes our cartilages are available to be rented by the week unfortunately none of our Cottages are currently available for a full week rental because some are already reserved on certain days

I have a final question could you tell me about renting on the 6th

I am afraid to inform you that the rooms on the 6th are all reserved so it's not possible to rent any room on that day

there are few reasons why I believe it is better to grow up in the country than in a city most importantly growing up in the country allows me to develop in an environment that is not very polluted for instance because there are fewer autonomobies the air quality is better in addition there will be less maybe even no noise pollution since they are not that many people or things creating unwanted noise these types of pollution can cause stress to an individual that can adversely affect his or her health another reason is that with today's technology living in the country is more comfortable than it was in the past for example entertainment and educational information can be easily assessed through the internet I do not have to travel all the way to the city of evil lived there when I can assess this of information on the internet in the comfort of my home hence I feel that it's better to grow up in the country than in a city
