00:11:06.240 support your answer
00:11:08.100 begin preparing now
00:11:40.380 thank you begin speaking now
00:11:43.800 there are few reasons why I believe it
00:11:46.440 is better to grow up in the country than
00:11:48.240 in a city most importantly growing up in
00:11:51.600 the country allows me to develop in an
00:11:54.000 environment that is not very polluted
00:11:56.220 for instance because there are fewer
00:11:58.980 autonomobies the air quality is better
00:12:01.980 in addition there will be less maybe
00:12:04.980 even no noise pollution since they are
00:12:07.500 not that many people or things creating
00:12:10.440 unwanted noise
00:12:12.000 these types of pollution can cause
00:12:14.459 stress to an individual that can
00:12:17.100 adversely affect his or her health
00:12:20.279 another reason is that with today's
00:12:22.740 technology living in the country is more
00:12:25.920 comfortable than it was in the past for
00:12:28.920 example entertainment and educational
00:12:31.200 information can be easily assessed
00:12:34.019 through the internet I do not have to
00:12:36.360 travel all the way to the city of evil
00:12:39.300 lived there when I can assess this of
00:12:41.940 information on the internet in the
00:12:44.579 comfort of my home hence I feel that
00:12:47.459 it's better to grow up in the country
00:12:49.260 than in a city
