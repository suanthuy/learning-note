how many credit cards do you have and how often do you use them begin

I only have one card and I think I use it nearly every day I use it quite often because I don't like to carry lots of cash also it's very useful when I'm running out of cash

![](./Images/mock-test-2-8.png)

what do you use your credit card for

well of course I use it to pay for items I buy at stores or on the internet I also use it to buy food every day so my credit card is absolutely necessary in my daily life

how could your credit card service be improved

well I think the security of credit cards should be improved the reason is that if it's stolen it can be used by strangers and cause a big problem for the owner for example I have a friend who's was host credit card was stolen recently and it was used to buy thousands of dollars worth of stuff therefore I definitely wish that credit cards were safer

well I agree with the idea that University students out to work part-time to get prepared for the business world the main reason is that working part-time teaches students important skills they will need in the future for example they can discover how to cooperate with their co-workers finish tasks on time deal with customers and so on the other reason is that working part-time jobs help students plan their future career what I mean is through work experience they can discover what sorts of work they like or dislike as well as what they're good at therefore I think it's a great idea for students to have various change chances to work part-time
