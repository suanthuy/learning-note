There is a picture taken at a big lecture hall in the foreground there are students sitting in wooden seats and the class looks very full most of the students are looking down so they're probably taking notes in the middle I can see some long tables with papers and other items on them in the background a teacher is standing with his back to the students he's wearing a brown sweater and blue jeans and is writing something on the Blackboard with chalk overall it looks like a typical classroom scene

would you rather spend time in your own garden or visit a large public garden

for me I would prefer to visit a large public garden the reason is that public gardens have a wide variety of beautiful plants and flowers while my own garden has only a limited variety for example when I went to the Botanical Garden near my house I was amazed by all the different kinds of flowers and plants and I had a great time there in this part of the test you will answer three questions based on the information provided

well in my opinion I think I would definitely accept an offer to work abroad first of all it would be interesting and beneficial to live in another country I could learn about an unfamiliar culture and meet people who are totally different from me it would also help me establish responsibility and make myself a stronger person although it would be a bit tough and challenging at times second it would give me an advantage in the job market for a promotion or career advancement these days employers prefer employees who have work experience abroad because that means they are capable of working in a variety of environments and speaking second languages therefore I think I'd happily accept an opportunity to work abroad
