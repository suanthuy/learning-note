00:06:52.500 begin speaking now
00:06:54.360 foreign
00:06:55.280 I generally prefer to go on vacation
00:06:58.380 abroad because that way I can get to
00:07:01.259 experience an exciting and different
00:07:03.660 culture last year I spent my vacation in
00:07:07.020 Thailand and I had a great time there

00:07:13.259 relax While others prefer excitement and
00:07:15.539 adventure

00:07:16.800 what do you look for in a vacation?

00:07:27.360 well for me I prefer to experience
00:07:30.479 excitement and Adventure on my vacation
00:07:33.800 that's because I like to do challenging
00:07:37.020 and exciting things to relieve stress
00:07:39.840 and make my vacation Unforgettable
00:07:42.900 for example when I went to Thailand I
00:07:45.660 tried various water sport and local food
00:07:48.960 it was so much fun to have new
00:07:51.660 experiences therefore I think it's
00:07:54.419 better for me to go somewhere through
00:07:56.940 fun and interesting activities in this

00:12:05.760 personally I would rather get news
00:12:09.120 online than read it in a newspaper for
00:12:13.079 starters it's more convenient in many
00:12:15.839 ways for example I can read all the word
00:12:19.200 next new papers from anywhere via my
00:12:23.519 laptop or mobile phone so I don't even
00:12:27.000 have to go out to the store to buy them
00:12:29.820 moreover mostly is free to read online
00:12:33.720 the other thing is that news websites
00:12:36.839 are more current than papers
00:12:39.560 newspaper only give an update on a
00:12:42.600 situation at the time of printing
00:12:44.899 whereas online news is totally up to the
00:12:49.079 minute therefore you can get the latest
00:12:52.019 news without waiting that is why I think
00:12:55.740 it's better to catch up with current
00:12:57.899 events to online news instead of a
00:13:01.200 newspaper
00:13:03.839 foreign
