How often do you take a vacation and who do you usually go with?

Well. I take a vacation about once a year with my close friends. I usually go during my summer break because that's the only time I can have a long vacation.

Do you prefer to go on vacation in your own country or abroad?

I generally prefer to go on vacation abroad, because that way I can get to experience an exciting and different culture. Last year, I spent my vacation in Thailand and I had a great time there.

Some people like to go on vacation to relax While others prefer excitement and adventure. What do you look for in a vacation?

Well. For me, I prefer to experience excitement and adventure on my vacation. That's because I like to do challenging and exciting things to relieve stress and make my vacation unforgettable. For example, when I went to Thailand, I tried various water sport and local food. It was so much fun to have new experiences. Therefore, I think it's better for me to go somewhere through fun and interesting activities.

personally I would rather get news
online than read it in a newspaper for
starters it's more convenient in many
ways for example I can read all the word
next new papers from anywhere via my
laptop or mobile phone so I don't even
have to go out to the store to buy them
moreover mostly is free to read online
the other thing is that news websites
are more current than papers
newspaper only give an update on a
situation at the time of printing
whereas online news is totally up to the
minute therefore you can get the latest
news without waiting that is why I think
it's better to catch up with current
events to online news instead of a
newspaper
