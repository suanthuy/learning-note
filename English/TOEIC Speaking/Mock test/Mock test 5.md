Do you like to receive perfume as a gift?

Well personally I I don't because I'm quite picky they are only a limited number of buffoon brands that I like so I prefer buying it by by myself rather than getting it as a gift

What are the things you consider when buying perfume?

Well the main thing I consider is that I want to to make sure the sun is mild the reason is that there's nothing worse than standing next to someone wearing um overpowering the film especially I hate being with someone wearing strong perfume in a small space like an elevator therefore whenever I buy perfume I always choose the um one with a mild scent

Well in my case I tried to avoid reviews before going to see a movie that's because reviews give away important information about the plot which we call movie spoilers for example before watching impossible mission I read a review which gave away the surprising ending it totally ruined the movie for me another thing is that reviews influence our or your opinion of a movie before you've even seen it by reading movie reviews beforehand you already get a negative or positive impression of it even worse a lot of movie productions are posting favorable reviews as part of their marketing strategy that's why I normally do not check movie reviews before I actually watch it foreign
