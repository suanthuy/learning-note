This is a picture of people relaxing on a beach. Some people are getting a tan while others are enjoying the water. I can see one woman on the right is lying on her side. There is an empty chair and a flag in the middle of the photo. In the background, there are palm trees and large houses on the side of the hill. It looks like a hot summer day, and so it is important to remember to apply suntan lotion.

This is a picture of a man giving a speech to an audience. The man is standing on a stage with a big screen behind him. I can see a woman sitting at a table that has microphones set up for others to have a panel discussion. The entire audience is focused on his speech. I can tell people in the audience are probably taking notes. I think the man is giving a speech at a university.

Do you prefer to watch movies on the computer or go to a movie theater why?

I prefer to watch movies on the computer. The biggest reason is that I am too busy and it's hard to find time to go to the movie theater. So I download some of some of the films, I don't want to miss on my computer and watch them on my way home on the bus.

Well when I go on a trip, I usually do not make any plans. I am a spontaneous kind of person, and I find that like to be surprised about the interesting places and activities available on my vacation. I went to Ho Chi Minh City last spring with a friend of mine. Neither of us made any plans, but we had the best time of our lives. We met up with some other vacationers and enjoyed some of the tours that they had booked. My friend and I did not waste time researching about what to do. We relied on the suggestions of others, and we were never disappointed. I think that personal accounts are more substantial than a brochure or Internet information that would be available if I were to plan my trip precisely beforehand. Also, on some days, I just want to relax and not do nothing. Hence, I don't bother making precise plans and prefer to do whatever I feel like doing during my vacation.
