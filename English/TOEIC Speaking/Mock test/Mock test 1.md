This is a picture of two people sitting in chairs by the water. They seem to be relaxing in the Sun and enjoying the nice day the man is drinking something and the woman appears to be sitting with her legs crossed. There's a black back on the grass next to the woman and the trees is casting a shadow across the grass I think it is a clear bright possibly in the spring or the fall.

Well I don't think that any harm in buying jewelry online as long as you do some careful research before buying anything. I'm buying from a reputable online jewelry store is probably the cheapest most convenient way to get jewelry these days.

Well I would much rather work in a group. One main reason is that I don't have another person there pushing me. Then I get distracted too easily often I have projects to do alone but can't get started or can't stay working on them consistently, so I get distracted and wander up to complete another task. The other main reason why I like working with a group is that I find it much easier to brainstorm for ideas when you have several people with different personalities and all talking together and trying to figure out. I really enjoy having someone else to talk and modeling over different ideas and thoughts to see what can work or what can't work. For such reason, I prefer to work in a group.
