This is a picture of a street. There are two tram racks on the road, and there is a tram on one of the tracks. The tram is white with a red stripe along the side of each carriage. In the background, there are four large buildings. On the left-hand side of the road, I can see a man walking on the sidewalk. There are also some other buildings in the background. The tram looks like a good way to get around the city.

This picture was taken in a cobble area outside a restaurant. Some tables have been set up outside the restaurant. Each table has four wooden chairs around it. Brightly colored table cloths have been placed on the tables and cutlery and glasses with napkins inside have been laid out. In the background, there is an old brick war. There is an rectangular hole in the wall. It seems like a nice place to have a meal outdoors.

Well. I normally visit the career sections of specific companies that interest me. Many organizations post job openings directly on their websites providing detailed information about the posision requirements, company cultures and application process.

How much time do you usually spend preparing for a job interview?

Well. The amount time, I spend preparing for a job interview can vary depending on various factors such as the level of job, the industry and some circumstances. But normally, I spend about two or three days preparing for a job interview.

When applying for a job, which aspect concerns you the most?

Well. The aspect that I'm concerned with is the salary. Although the other factors are quite important, they don't matter if you don't have enough money to have a good life. Also, it will allow me to open my business with the money in the future. So, I can say that I'd prefer to have a job with good pay than a job with lots of vacation or other non-financial benefits.

Well. I agree that children should not be allowed to use cell phones at school for the following reasons. First of all, it can be a major distraction in school. For example, when students send text messages to one another in class, the sounds of phones beeping or vibrating make it difficult for students and teachers to concentrate. Another reason is that cell phones discourage children from being social. For instance, with the advent of the smartphones, many children spend more time playing with their phones than spending time with friends. For these reason, I believe children should not be allowed to use cell phone at school.
