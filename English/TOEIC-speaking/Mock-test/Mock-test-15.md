## Question 11

Do you think it's useful to check information about a product on the company's website before buying it? (8-10 sentences)

The main reason is that S + V.

No, I don't think it's useful to check information about a product on the company's website before buying it. The main reason is that information on the company's website is often incomplete.

==> reason or result

Because companies want to sell more products, they tend to mention only the good features of the product on their website and hide the bad ones. Therefore, it's difficult for customers to have a complete understanding of the product.

Let me tell you my story. Last year, I brought a smartphone after checking information about it on the company's website. According to the description on the website, it can take beautiful photos and it can store many files.

When I received the smartphone, it did take beautiful photos and it did store many files. However, It also run out of battery very quickly. This bad feature was not mentioned on the website.

That's why I think so.
