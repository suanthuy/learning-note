Good morning, I am very happy to be your guide today. During our tour of the Green Garden, you will have the opportunity to see a wide selection of plants, from delicate flowers to towering trees. You are encouraged to explore different areas of the garden at your own pace. However, please remember to stay on the designated path, check the time schedule in the brochure, and do not pick the flowers.
