## Question 11

Which of the following is the MOST important quality for a customer service agent?

-   Being friendly
-   Being a good listener
-   Being highly experienced

Choose ONE of the options and use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.

> being friendly
>
> not satisfied with their service
>
> mobile phone - not friendly -rude - not answer
>
> next - friendly - always smile; willing to support; answer all of questions
>
> ==> recommend

Well. I think the most important quality for a customer service agent is being friendly. Because if the customer service agent is not friendly, the customer may not feel satisfied with their service and they will choose other store or other company. In my own experience, last month, I need to buy a new mobile phone. I choose a store near my house. However, the attitude of that store was not friendly. He didn't answer my questions. He was rude. So I went to the store next door and their attitude was totally different. Their agent there always smiled and willing to support me. Moreover, they answered all of my questions. So I am satisfied with that and recommend that store to my friends.

> experience
>
> solve customer's complaints quickly
>
> leader - experienced customer service agent
>
> worked for many years in this field
>
> complain about the fault/ defect out of product
>
> apologized to customers, call technical department, offer 10% discount => customer satisfied => loyal customer

I think the most important quality that a customer service agent should have is being highly experienced. Because with a lot of experience, the customer service agent can show the customer's complaint quickly. I will tell the story of my leader. She is a really experienced customer service agent because she has worked for many years in this field. I remembered one the customer complaining about the defect of the product. Because she faced the problem before, she could solve it immediately. First, she apologized to the customer. Then, she called the technical department to fix the mistake. And she also offered the 10% discount for the customer.
