This picture was taken in a classroom. Some people who seem to be students are in a group discussing something. A woman on the right is holding a red folder and gesturing. I think she's giving a lecture or an explanation to the class. Next to her a man in a blue sweater is folding his arms and looking at the lecture. The rest of the students are also looking at her and listening carefully

This is a picture of a food vendor preparing a meal. On the left, a main in a red jacket seems to be buying some bread. There are two people on the right side of the picture. One is pointing at the vendor and the other is carrying something on his shoulder. Two motorbikes are parked in front of the shop. I can see a few men passing by in the back. The people look busy so I guess this picture was taken in the morning

What is your favorite restaurant and why?

Actually, the restaurant I like the best is a little Japanese place downtown that specializes in raw fish and sushi. I like that place because it use fresh ingredients and its prices are reasonable.

What factors influence decision when you choose a restaurant?

The two main factors I consider when choosing a restaurant are healthiness and cost. First, I don't eat a restaurant that is a lot of artificial seasonings or too much salt, as is very unhealthy. Furthermore, I hate spending too much money when dining out because I have a tight budget. Therefore, I think it's important to check whether the restaurant serves healthy food at a reasonable price.

Well. I agree that an employee's performance appraisal should be based mainly on the manager's evaluation. The main reason is that the manager is in the best position to assess a worker's performance. I mean, managers aside and monitor employee's work directly. Therefore, they know how quickly and effectively employees perform tasks. In addition, managers are the best people to give the detailed and constructive feedback to employees. Performance appraisals should also aim to improve employee's skills. And considering managers' many years of work experience, they are able to provide workers with informative feedback. For these reasons, I think it's a great idea to allow managers to evaluate their employees performance.
